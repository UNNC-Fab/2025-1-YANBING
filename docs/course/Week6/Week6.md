# 3D Printing
## FDM Printing
**1. FDM introduction**

Fused deposition modeling, or FDM for short, is a material extrusion method of additive manufacturing where materials are extruded through a nozzle and joined together to create 3D objects.

Now, we will use the Vase generator to design a vase.

Adjust the parameters of the vase, DIY your favourite vase.

Finally, download the design and open it with Bambu Studio.

To finish the 3D printing successfully. we need to set the parameters of the printing.

(1) Set the nozzle scale

According to the target of design, the normal appearance of the 3D model set the nozzle scale to 0.2mm. For the engennering application, the nozzle scale should be set to 0.4-0.6mm.

(2) Layer height: standard height should more than 0.2mm, the need for mechanical strength could be set to 0.4mm.

(3) Layer number: Set it with the level of mechanical strength. Normal design for 2 layers, special design for more than 4 layers.

(4) Inner hatch patterns: honeycomb pattern is strong, with angle of 45Â°.

(5) Adjust the model to fit the printing bed

Such as: zoom, moving, rootate, cut, text add, material color selection, measure etc.

Choose the underside to print.

(6) Slice preview

To print the model, we need to slice the model and preview the slice effect. In this page, the material consumption can be estimated. The warning will point out the potential problems of the design.

(7) Print

Connect the printer with the computer and upload the design file.
