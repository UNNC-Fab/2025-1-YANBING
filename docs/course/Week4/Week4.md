## Fusion 360
Fusion 360 is a cloud-based CAD/CAM/CAE tool for collaborative product development. Fusion 360 combines fast and easy organic modeling with precise solid modeling, allowing you to make your designs manufacturable. Last but not least,With the help of Eagle,Fusion has the function of Electromechanical.

**1. Creat sketch**

Firstly, creat a new part.

To define the sketch compeletly, some sizes are needed to ensure,such as the angle, length etc. In addition, the place of the sketch should be defined, whcih is the length between sketch and origin point.

**2. Creat part**

To convert the sketch into a part, we will use stretch tool to pull the sketch along a direction. The thickness is defined in this process.
