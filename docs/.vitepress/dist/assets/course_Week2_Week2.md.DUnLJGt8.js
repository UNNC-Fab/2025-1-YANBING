Firstly, Adjust parameters such as welding current, voltage and welding speed according to the welding materials and requirements. Secondly, insert the parts to be welded into the solder paste. During the welding process, try to keep the welding torch steady to avoid false welding. After the welding is completed, a voltmeter should be used to test the function of the welded parts to avoid short circuit or open circuit caused by welding problems.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="p7"></p><h2 id="_2-ardunio-hardware" tabindex="-1">2.

It is a small, low-power development board suitable for embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT) applications and other projects. Features Bluetooth and WIFI communication and supports up to 11 GPIO pins.Provides stable power management, supports 3.3V input and provides stable voltage output through integrated LDO (Low Voltage Difference Regulator).</p><p>More information about chip：<a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">esp32 XIAO</a></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="p8"></p><h2 id="_3-ardunio-code" tabindex="-1">3.

Short-connecting problem of led bulb in breadboard. 2. The sensor connection port is correctly connected to the chip. 3, the small bulb connection resistance is too large to cause the problem of not bright.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="p9"></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="p10"></p>',12)]))}const f=t(c,[["render",l]]);export{_ as __pageData,f as default};
